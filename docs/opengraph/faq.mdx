<Accordion title="Can I delete data ingested via OpenGraph?">
Yes you can!

You can remove generic data through using one of the following three (3) options: 

1. Cypher commands in the Explore UI
    - Requires `enable_cypher_mutations: true` in config. For more info [click here](/manage-bloodhound/bh-config#enable-cypher-mutations)

2. Admin UI → Database Management page
    - The following checkboxes will be displayed
    - All Data
    - Active Directory Data
    - Azure Data
    - … X Data (there will be 0 or more checkboxes here that allow you to delete any data that had been ingested with a `source_kind` provided)
    - Sourceless Data (checking this box will delete all entities that do not have a kind that can be found in the `source_kinds` table.  You can observe the `source_kinds` your Bloodhound instance is currently aware of by calling `GET api/v2/graphs/source_kinds`.)

3. API: `Clear-Database`
    - See the [OpenGraph API Page](API) for more inforation

<Accordion title="The bestest question of all?">
SharpHound Enterprise installs as a signed Windows service. For this reason, antivirus products tend not to alert on the service.

Notable exceptions include:

* Behavioral analytics tools: Any security tool that performs behavioral identification of scanners will flag SharpHound Enterprise as a scanner during local privileged collection. Typically these cannot block activity but will generate alerts to the SOC.
* Cisco Umbrella: As each customer is deployed utilizing their own domain, Umbrella commonly flags the domain as new and will quarantine it until excluded by an administrator.
