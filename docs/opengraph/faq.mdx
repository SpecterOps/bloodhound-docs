<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I define my own icons in OpenGraph?">
Yes you can!
You can find all the details [here](custom-icons)
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I delete data ingested via OpenGraph?">
Yes you can!

You can remove generic data by using one of the following three (3) options:

1. Cypher commands in the Explore UI
    - Requires `enable_cypher_mutations: true` in config. For more info [click here](/manage-bloodhound/bh-config#enable-cypher-mutations)

2. Admin UI → Database Management page
    - The following checkboxes will be displayed
    - All Data
    - Active Directory Data
    - Azure Data
    - … X Data (there will be 0 or more checkboxes here that allow you to delete any data that had been ingested with a `source_kind` provided)
    - Sourceless Data (checking this box will delete all entities that do not have a kind that can be found in the `source_kinds` table.  You can observe the `source_kinds` your BloodHound instance is currently aware of by calling `GET api/v2/graphs/source_kinds`.)

3. API: `Clear-Database`
    - See the [OpenGraph API Page](/opengraph/API) for more information

<Accordion title="Do custom nodes & edges work with Search and Pathfinding?">
No, not yet.

In the initial BloodHound 8.0 release, OpenGraph nodes and edges are not supported in the Search or Pathfinding tab, so the Cypher tab **must** be used to query the data manually.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How can I add my project to the OpenGraph library?">
Have you built a cool project using OpenGraph and want it featured here? Already got your project in the list and need to update something? Open a ["Library Change" issue](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/issues) on the BloodHound Docs repo and we'll get it added for you!

Submissions from the community will have a <Icon icon="people-group" color="#ffffff" /> icon next to them while those by SpecterOps employees will have a SpecterOps icon.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why is it taking so long to ingest OpenGraph data?">
Slow ingestion speeds are commonly seen when using a Neo4j graph database and are typically resolved by switching to a PostgreSQL backend. For full, officially supported OpenGraph functionality, use a PostgreSQL backend (see [Requirements](/opengraph/best-practices#requirements)).

To switch to a PostgreSQL graph database, set `"graph_driver": "pg"` in your `bloodhound.config.json` file and restart the BloodHound services/containers. You will need to re-ingest any data into the new database.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do OpenGraph nodes disappear after ingestion?">
There is a reconciliation step in BloodHound Enterprise Edition (BHE) that deletes orphaned nodes (nodes that have no edge relationships) shortly after ingestion. This is distinct from the edge [post-processing](/opengraph/schema#post-processing) behavior and is intended to reduce stale or unconnected objects in the graph.

**What this means:**

- Ingesting nodes without edges in BloodHound Community Edition (BHCE) successfully creates and displays all of the nodes, including orphaned nodes.
- For the same data uploaded to BloodHound Enterprise Edition (BHE), the nodes without edges are ingested and immediately deleted during the reconciliation step.

**Recommended workaround:**

Use a two-step upload when building hybrid paths.

- **First payload (isolated subgraph)**: Upload only your OpenGraph nodes and relationships and set `source_kind` in `metadata`. Ensure that every node has at least one relationship within this payload (for example, connect nodes to each other or to a root and add a containment edge such as `(:OGRoot)-[:OGContains]->(:YourNode)`). Do not link to AD/AZ objects in this payload.

- **Second payload (linking AD/AZ nodes)**: Link the isolated subgraph's nodes to the AD/AZ nodes that connect your subgraph to existing AD/AZ entities. This avoids cross-source side effects when `source_kind` is present.
