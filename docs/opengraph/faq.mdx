<Accordion title="The bestest question of all?">
SharpHound Enterprise installs as a signed Windows service. For this reason, antivirus products tend not to alert on the service.

Notable exceptions include:

* Behavioral analytics tools: Any security tool that performs behavioral identification of scanners will flag SharpHound Enterprise as a scanner during local privileged collection. Typically these cannot block activity but will generate alerts to the SOC.
* Cisco Umbrella: As each customer is deployed utilizing their own domain, Umbrella commonly flags the domain as new and will quarantine it until excluded by an administrator.
