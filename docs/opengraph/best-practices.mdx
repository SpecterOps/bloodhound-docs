# Introduction

This page aims to collect the Best Practices to create [Graph Extentions](./library.mdx) and tooling for OpenGraph. 

# Creating a new OpenGraph Extention

## Elements of a Complete Submission

This section lists the elements that are mandatory and the nice to have in an OpenGraph Extension submission. 

### Mandatory

1. A Collector/Hound
    - A script that can be used to collect all the information needed to poulate the Graph
    - The collector should create the JSON that can be u/l to BloodHound
    - Nice to have: Ability to u/l the JSON output to the BloodHound instance via the [API](/integrations/bloodhound-api/working-with-api) without user interaction
        - Need [API Key](http://localhost:3000/integrations/bloodhound-api/working-with-api#authentication)

1. Documentation on 
    - Minimum system requirements to run the tool
        - OS
        - Software
        - Resources
    - How to install the Collector
    - How to use the Collector
        - Minimum permission needed to collect the information
            - As a privileged user
            - As an unprivileged user
        - Command line options/switches
            - Example of how you would run the tool from the command line

### Nice to Have

1. Edge Information in the JSON
    - General
    - Abuse Info
    - OPSEC
    - References
    - Etc.

1. Cypher Queries "Starter Pack"
    - Cypher Queries to help new users explore the new elements introduced to the Graph
    - Should be in the Custom Query JSON format for easy ingestion

1. Nodes & Edges Documentation (online)
    - Wiki format (can be GitHub) or;
    - Markdown file 

1. Icon Definition Pack
    - Including a script to u/l them. See [example](/opengraph/custom-icons#example-with-python)
        - Can use a [Bearer Token](http://localhost:3000/integrations/bloodhound-api/working-with-api#use-a-jwt%2Fbearer-token) instead of API Key as it will run only once.
