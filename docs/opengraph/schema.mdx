# Schema

In this section, you will find all the information to create a JSON file that BloodHound can ingest and use to diplay your Nodes and Edges.

The most up-to-date JSON Schema can always be found in our CE repository. Currently, the location of the node and edge schema files in our source code can be found [here](https://github.com/SpecterOps/BloodHound/tree/main/cmd/api/src/services/upload/jsonschema).

# Ingesting Generic Formatted Data

## File Requirements

Acceptable formats: `.json`, `.zip`

You can mix file types in a single upload (e.g. Sharphound + Generic).

Compressed ZIPs containing multiple file types are supported.

## JSON Format

The standard Bloodhound UI upload screen now accepts files in a generic format. You can continue using it as before. 

At minimum, your JSON file should have these elements:

``` JSON
{
  "graph": {
    "nodes": [],
    "edges": []
  }
}
```

The `nodes` and `edges` must conform to our JSON Schema, see details below. The validation of the data occurs at upload time.

When ingest completes, the generic data will be available via **Cypher search ONLY**. Generic data is not searchable via the pathfinding feature (yet).

**Entity Panels**: clicking on a generic node or edge will only render the entity’s property bag. At this time there is no support for defining entity panels for generic entities.


## Nodes 

### Property Rules

Properties must be primitive types or arrays of primitive types

Nested objects and arrays of objects are not allowed

Arrays must be homogeneous (e.g. all strings or all numbers)

### Node JSON
``` JSON

    "title": "Generic Ingest Node",

## Minimal Working JSON
The following is the most simple JSON file we could come up with. You can use it as a starting point to build your own Open Graph.

``` JSON
{
  "graph": {
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "123",
        "kinds": [
          "Person",
          "Base"
        ],
        "properties": {
          "displayname": "bob",
          "property": "a",
          "objectid": "123",
          "name": "BOB"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": "234",
        "kinds": [
          "Person",
          "Base"
        ],
        "properties": {
          "displayname": "alice",
          "property": "b",
          "objectid": "234",
          "name": "ALICE"
        }
      }
    ],
    "edges": [
      {
        "kind": "Knows",
        "start": {
          "value": "123",
          "match_by": "id"
        },
        "end": {
          "value": "234",
          "match_by": "id"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

# Streaming Support

<Warning> Streaming Support is not available yet. </Warning>

This schema is supports ingest of an entire subgraph, where the source and target nodes exist for every edge specified. In order to support streaming vs batch processing, a few minor changes can be made to the schema

- First,  add a flag (e.g., `allow_orphan`) to the edge schema to indicate whether an edge can be stored without its corresponding node(s) being present.

- When the system processes an **orphaned edge** (i.e., an edge where one or both of its nodes are missing), store it temporarily, in a **pending state** (extend the existing `edge` table to have a status field that can be one of `pending`, or `resolved`)

- When either the `sourceId` or `targetId` arrives, it can trigger a **process to check and resolve** the orphaned edges.

## Edge Cases

If a node never arrives: utilize a **timeout or expiration** for orphaned edges. If a node isn’t received within a certain time window, the edge can be **discarded** or flagged in a **failed** state

## Example Workflow

1. Node A is ingested: `{"id": "A", "name": "Node A"}`

2. An edge is ingested: `{"kind": "HasSession", "sourceId": {"value": "A"}, "targetId": {"value": "B"}, "allow_orphan": true}`

3. The edge is stored with a pending status because targetId (Node B) is missing.

4. Node B arrives: `{"id": "B", "name": "Node B"}`

5. The system checks pending edges and finds the edge from Node A to Node B. The edge is now **resolved**.
