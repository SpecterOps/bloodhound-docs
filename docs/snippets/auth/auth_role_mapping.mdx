## User Role Mapping
First/last name and email are populated when the correct key/value are provided in the {auth_mode} assertion payload. If omitted, fields default to the user's email.

A role is applied when the roles key is present and its value is a properly formatted BloodHound role.
Role values use the prefix `bh-` and are written in kebab-case.  
See role definitions for capabilities and scopes: [Users and Roles](/manage-bloodhound/auth/users-and-roles) 

| **Role** | **Key Value** |
| --- | --- |
|User|bh-user| 
|Power User|bh-power-user|
|Administrator|bh-administrator|
|Upload Only|bh-upload-only|
|Read Only |bh-read-only|

Only one role will be accepted in the roles claim. If more than one role is provided, the provider default role will apply.
