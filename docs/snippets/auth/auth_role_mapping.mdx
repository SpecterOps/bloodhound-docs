## User Role Mapping
First/last name and email are populated when the correct key/value are provided in the {auth_mode} assertion payload. If omitted, fields default to the user's email.

The role is applied when the roles key is present and its value is a properly formatted BloodHound role.
Role values use the prefix `bh-` and are written in kebab-case.  
See role definitions for capabilities and scopes: [Users and Roles](/manage-bloodhound/auth/users-and-roles)
