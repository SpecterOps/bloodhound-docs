## Server Requirements

### Hardware

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | **Minimum** | **Recommended** | **Large Enterprise  <br/>** |
| **Processor Cores** | 2 physical cores | 4 physical cores | 6 physical cores |
| **Memory** | 4GB RAM | 16GB RAM | 32GB RAM |
| **Hard disk space** | 1GB for logging | 5GB for logging | 20GB for logging |

**These recommendations should be considered a baseline that may need to be increased depending on the size and complexity of your environments.**

Minimums apply to test and development deployments.
Where multiple collectors are deployed on a single host, scaling wll be necessary to maintain performance.
