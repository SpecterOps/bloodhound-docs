title: OwnsLimitedRights
description: "When specific privileges on an object's DACL are explicitly granted to the `OWNER RIGHTS` SID (S-1-3-4), implicit owner rights (e.g., WriteDacl) are blocked, and the owner is granted only the specific privileges granted to OWNER RIGHTS. This can be used to limit the rights of the owner of an object."
