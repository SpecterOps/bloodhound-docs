<div data-glossary-term="Attack Path">

## Attack Path

A chain of abusable privileges and user behaviors that create direct and indirect connections between computers and users. In BloodHound, attack paths are visualized in the [graph](#graph) by [nodes](#node) and [edges](#edge). Learn more in [What is Attack Path Management](https://bloodhoundenterprise.io/what-is-attack-path-management/).

- **Identity-based attack path**—An attack path is based on identity/an already authenticated [principal](#principal). BloodHound's main goal is to help visualize and manage attack paths.

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="Attack Path Management (APM)">

## Attack Path Management (APM)

The process of identifying, analyzing, and managing the [attack paths](#attack-path) that an adversary might exploit to reach high-value objects or compromise the network's security. BloodHound helps visualize and manage attack paths through Attack Path Management.

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="Choke Point">

## Choke Point

A [privilege](#privilege) or user behavior (called [edges](#edge)) that, like the driveway to a house, connects the rest of the environment through an object or collection of objects (called [nodes](#node)). For example, any Edge into the collection of [Tier Zero](#tier-zero%2Fhigh-value) nodes is a Tier Zero Choke Point. This is a privilege or user behavior the adversary must abuse to compromise a Tier Zero object.

Choke points are significant points of control and defense in the network security architecture. They represent the optimal location to block the largest number of [attack paths](#attack-path). BloodHound Enterprise calculates [exposure](#exposure) for all choke points.

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="Collector">

## Collector

A collector, collector client, or data collector is software that collects [attack path](#attack-path)-related data from a [directory](#directory). For example, SharpHound and AzureHound.

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="Cypher">

## Cypher

[Cypher](https://opencypher.org/) is a [graph](#graph) query language used to interact with BloodHound's database. It's similar to SQL for traditional databases. To use it, see [Searching with Cypher](/analyze-data/bloodhound-gui/cypher-search).

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="Directory">

## Directory

A service that stores identities and their attributes, such as Active Directory (AD) and Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory). BloodHound collects data from these directories to build its [graph](#graph) of [nodes](#node) and [edges](#edge).

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="Edge">

## Edge

An edge is part of the [graph](#graph) construct and represents a relationship between two [nodes](#node), indicating some form of interaction. See [About BloodHound Edges](/resources/edges/overview).

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="Enterprise Access Model (EAM)">

## Enterprise Access Model (EAM)

A security framework developed by Microsoft that defines a privileged access strategy\[[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/privileged-access-workstations/privileged-access-access-model)\] with the ultimate goal of preventing privilege escalation through [identity-based attack paths](#attack-path). In most cases, EAM supersedes and replaces [tiering](#tiering%2Ftier-model).

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="Escalation (ESC)">

## Escalation (ESC)

A series of Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) attack paths that BloodHound can detect. These are escalation techniques that abuse misconfigurations in certificate services.

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="Exposure">

## Exposure

The percentage of [principals](#principal) in a [directory](#directory) with a [Tier Zero](#tier-zerohigh-value) [attack path](#attack-path). It encompasses both principals with one-step paths (`UserA -[ForceChangePassword]-> TierZero`), and multi-step paths (`UserA -[ForceChangePassword]-> UserB -[GenericAll]-> TierZero`). BloodHound Enterprise calculates exposure for all [choke points](#choke-point).

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="Finding">

## Finding

A specific instance of a vulnerability that an attacker could abuse to gain access to, and eventually take control of, a network. Each finding can be categorized as a specific [attack path](#attack-path) type.

There are two types of findings in BloodHound:

- **List-based finding**—A finding for a specific [principal](#principal) where the vulnerability is related to the principal itself, such as a misconfiguration. Because of this nature, list-based findings do not necessarily have an [exposure](#exposure) metric (as they are theoretically completely exposed), but they will
have an [impact](#impact) metric.

- **Relationship-based finding**—A finding for a pair of [principals](#principal)—a target that is privileged (such as belonging to Tier Zero) and a source/origin that is not—that can be compromised by one or more connections between said principals. Each relationship-based finding may be composed of one or many individual [attack paths](#attack-path).

  A relationship-based finding can have an [exposure](#exposure) metric (the exposure risk of the source/origin principal being compromised) and an [impact](#impact) metric (the impact risk of the target principal being compromised).

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="FOSS">

## FOSS

Stands for Free and Open Source Software. For example, "BloodHound CE is a FOSS project."

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="Graph">

## Graph

The graph database used by BloodHound. It stores the relationships between [nodes](#node) and [edges](#edge) and feeds BloodHound functionality like visualizing and understanding complex [attack paths](#attack-path) and environment risks.

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="Impact">

## Impact

Refers to a risk measurement that quantifies how much of your environment could be affected by an attack path. Specifically:

- **Impact count**—The number of principals/objects that could be compromised through an attack path.

- **Impact percentage**—The percentage of the environment that could be impacted by a specific identity vulnerability.

Impact is closely related to [exposure](#exposure), which measures the percentage of principals with a *Tier Zero* attack path. Together, these metrics help organizations prioritize remediation by understanding which attack paths pose the greatest risk.

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="Kind">

## Kind

The schema-level classification or label applied to [nodes](#node) in the [graph](#graph), analogous to an entity type, not an individual node instance. Examples of node kinds include users, computers, groups, and domains. See [About BloodHound Nodes](/resources/nodes/overview).

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="Node">

## Node

A node is part of the [graph](#graph) construct and represents an entity in the environment as stored in the BloodHound graph. Nodes typically correspond to directory [objects](#object) or other assets, such as users, computers, groups, or domains. Two nodes can be connected by an [edge](#edge). See [About BloodHound Nodes](/resources/nodes/overview).

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="Object">

## Object

A directory-level entity within Active Directory and Entra ID [directories](#directory), such as users, groups, computers, organizational units (OUs), domains, and trusts.

Objects exist in the directory service itself; many of them are also represented as [nodes](#node) in the BloodHound graph. Each object represents a distinct element contributing to the network's overall structure and security posture. An object can also be referred to as an "asset".

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="Principal">

## Principal

A type of [object](#object) that can authenticate and be assigned permissions within the environment, also known as a security principal.

Examples of principals include users and computers in Active Directory and users, virtual machines, and service principal objects in Entra ID and Azure. Principals are typically represented as [nodes](#node) in the graph and play a central role in identity attack path mechanisms.

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="Privilege">

## Privilege

A level of access or permission a principal has on a specific object within the infrastructure.

Privileges are generally more granular permissions that define how or to what extent a user or system can interact with specific resources, like reading, writing, or executing a file. While similar to rights, privileges focus on resource-specific actions and are a subset of broader [rights](#right).

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="Remediation">

## Remediation

The process of fixing or mitigating security risks identified during the analysis of attack paths with BloodHound.

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="Right">

## Right

Rights are broad permissions granted to a user, group, or system to perform specific actions at a system or role level, such as logging in or accessing a network. They are sometimes used interchangeably with privileges but typically encompass higher-level abilities that define what someone can do across the system.

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="Tenant">

## Tenant

A BloodHound Enterprise tenant is hosted and managed by SpecterOps (SasS), while BloodHound CE is self-hosted and self-managed.

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="Tier Zero/High Value">

## Tier Zero/High Value

The most critical and sensitive objects in the network, typically including domain controllers and other core infrastructure components. The term stems from [tiering](#tiering%2Ftier-model).

</div>

<div data-glossary-term="Tiering/Tier Model">

## Tiering/Tier Model

The process of categorizing objects and privileges based on their criticality and importance to the organization. The term stems from Microsoft's Active Directory tier model, which in most cases is superseded and replaced by the Enterprise Access Model. See [Enterprise Access Model (EAM)](#enterprise-access-model).
