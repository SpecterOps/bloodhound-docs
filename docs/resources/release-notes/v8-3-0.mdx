## BloodHound (v8.3.0)

### New and Improved Features

- **New modeling for AdminSDHolder** - Gain deeper insights into privilege escalation paths involving Tier Zero groups in your environment. A new [`ProtectAdminGroups`](/edges/resources/protect-admin-groups) non-traversable edge connects the `AdminSDHolder` Active Directory container in each domain to all user, computer, and group nodes that it protects. The `ProtectAdminGroups` edge tracks the relationship between the `AdminSDHolder` security descriptor and protected nodes (requires SharpHound v2.8.0 or later).

  <Note>See the [AdminSDHolder: Misconceptions and Myths](https://specterops.io/resources/adminsdholder) blog post to learn more.</Note>

- **Privilege Zones History** - Audit and track changes to your Zones and Labels over time using the new **History** tab. This tab displays what type of change occurred, who made it, and when it happened. BloodHound retains 90 days of history from the last successful analysis operation.

- **_[BHE Only]_ Custom Glyphs for Privilege Zones** - Assign custom glyphs to your additional Privilege Zones to make different zones easier to distinguish on the **Explore** page.

- **Sample Results for Selectors** - As a read-only user, view sample results for selectors directly within the **Selector Details** view to better understand selector impacts.
  
- **_[CE Only]_ Privilege Zones enabled by default** - Start organizing your environment right away! Privilege Zones are now enabled by default on all new deployments.

- **Finished Job Logs and File Ingest Details Panel** - Easily access detailed information about your data collection jobs and file ingests. Click on any job or ingest ID in the **Finished Jobs Log** or **File Ingest** pages to show detailed information, including status, status message, duration, user or client name, and more.

- **Finished Job Logs and File Ingest Search and Filter** - Search through manual and scheduled data collection job logs. The **Finished Jobs Log** and **File Ingest** pages now provide a search box and filters to help you identify specific jobs or ingests quickly. Common filters include status, date range, and user or client name. The **Finished Jobs Log** also includes a filter for data collected.

- **Improved Data Quality Environment Selector** - Find and select environments more easily. The environment selector on the **Data Quality** page now supports longer lists of active environments.

- **_[BHE Only]_ Logarithmic Scale for Posture Charts** - Enhance your chart readability on the **Posture** page by switching from linear to logarithmic scale. Activate this option to better visualize various scenarios, including minimal fluctuations, significant deviations, outliers, and anomalous or discrepant data points.
