<Update label="BloodHound" tags={["Administration", "New Feature"]}>
  {/*BED-6674*/} **New Auditor Role**
  
  Grant appropriate access to users who need visibility without modification permissions. The new [Auditor role](/manage-bloodhound/auth/users-and-roles#user-role-definitions) provides read-only access to all application settings, configurations, findings, audit logs, and integration service accounts (like the BloodHound Enterprise Splunk App).

  This eliminates the need to grant full **Administrator** permissions just to access audit logs or view system configurations.

</Update>

<Update label="BloodHound" tags={["Zone Management", "Enhancement"]}>
  {/*BED-6516*/} **Privilege Zone Rules (Renamed)**
  
  Navigate Privilege Zones with confidence using the new "Rules" terminology instead of "Selectors."

  Based on user feedback, we found "Selectors" caused confusion about defining zone membership. The new name better reflects that [rules](/analyze-data/privilege-zones/rules) define the criteria that determine which objects belong to a zone.

<Update label="BloodHound" tags={["Zone Management", "Enhancement"]}>
  {/*BED-6624*/} **Context-Aware Edit Button**
  
  Avoid accidentally editing the wrong component. The **Edit** button on the **Privilege Zone Management** page now dynamically updates to show exactly what you're editing.
  
  When you click the **Zones** and **Labels** tabs, you'll see **Edit Zone** and **Edit Label** respectively. If you select a rule in the detail view, the button changes to **Edit Rule**.

<Update label="BloodHound" tags={["Zone Management", "Enhancement"]}>
  {/*BED-6625*/} **Improved Selection Highlighting**
  
  Know exactly what you're working on in the **Privilege Zone Management** page with clearer visual feedback.
  
  When you select a zone, label, or rule in the **Detail** view, the vertical blue highlight bar now appears beside your selected item only, making it immediately obvious which component is active.

</Update>

<Update label="BloodHound" tags={["Zone Management", "Enhancement"]}>
  {/*BED-6698*/} **Smarter Certification Defaults**
  
  Automatically tag objects by default after [creating a new rule](/analyze-data/privilege-zones/rules#define-a-rule). New rules now default to **Initial Members** certification instead of **Off**, making zone management more intuitive and aligned with user expectations.
</Update>

<Update label="BloodHound" tags={["Zone Management", "Enhancement"]}>
  {/*BED-6702*/} **Environment Filter on Certifications Tab**
  
  Filter [certifications](/analyze-data/privilege-zones/certification) by specific environments. The **Certifications** tab on the **Privilege Zone Management** page now includes an **Environment** filter for more targeted certification management.

</Update>

<Update label="BloodHound" tags={["Zone Management", "Enhancement"]}>
  {/*BED-6709*/} **Default Glyphs for Built-in Zones and Labels**
  
  Quickly identify critical assets and compromised objects with default icons. Objects tagged to the built-in **Tier Zero** zone and **Owned** label now display gem (<Icon icon="gem" />) or skull (<Icon icon="skull" iconType="solid"/>) icons by default.

</Update>

<Update label="BloodHound" tags={["Zone Management", "Enhancement"]}>
  {/*BED-6630*/} **Visual Object Type Indicators**
  
  Scan and understand the composition of your zones at a glance. The **Total Count** panel on the **Privilege Zone Management** page now displays icons next to each object type, helping you quickly identify what types of objects (e.g., users, groups, computers) are included in each zone.

</Update>

<Update label="BloodHound" tags={["Zone Management", "Enhancement"]}>
  {/*BED-6629*/} **Clearer System Attribution**
  
  Distinguish between system defaults and user modifications. System-created rules and automatic certifications now show **BloodHound** as the creator instead of **SYSTEM**.
  
  This makes it clearer throughout the interface, including the **History** tab and rule details, which actions BloodHound automatically performed versus those made by your team members.

</Update>

<Update label="BloodHound" tags={["Zone Management", "Enhancement"]}>
  {/*BED-6158*/} **Consistent Zone Terminology**
  
  Navigate Privilege Zones with confidence using the new "zone" terminology instead of "tier". We've updated terminology across Privilege Zones to consistently use "zone" instead of "tier".
  
  This includes changing references like "multi-tier" to "multi-zone" throughout the interface.
</Update>

<Update label="BloodHound" tags={["Zone Management", "Enhancement"]}>
  {/*BED-6704*/} **Better Guidance for Zone Configuration**
  
  Get in-product guidance about Privilege Zone [configuration options](/analyze-data/privilege-zones/zones). The **Enable Analysis** option when editing a zone now includes a helpful tooltip explaining what it does:
  
  >Enables Analysis to produce Attack Path Findings for the Zone.
  
  We've also refined field labels throughout the zone details panel to be clearer and more consistent.

</Update>

<Update label="BloodHound" tags={["Posture", "Enhancement"]}>
  {/*BED-6418*/} **More Accurate Completeness Metrics**
  
  Trust your [completeness metrics](/analyze-data/posture-page#completeness-graphs) to reflect real-world coverage. We've refined how BloodHound calculates session and local group completeness so it now reflects only truly active computers (enabled and logged in within the last 14 days).

  Check the updated tooltips on the **Posture** and **Data Quality** pages to understand what "active" means and prioritize expanding collection where you see gaps.

<Update label="BloodHound Enterprise" tags={["Posture", "Enhancement"]}>
  {/*BED-6744*/} **Revised Kerberos Delegation Risk Finding** <Badge shape="rounded" size="sm" stroke color="purple">Enterprise Edition</Badge>
  
  Protect Tier Zero from Kerberos delegation abuse. We renamed and re-wrote the legacy _Kerberos Delegation on Tier Zero Objects_ finding to _Tier Zero Objects Lack Kerberos Delegation Protection_ to more accurately communicate the risk presented by the finding.
  
  This finding only applies to Tier Zero going forward.

</Update>

<Update label="BloodHound" tags={["API", "Enhancement"]}>
  {/*BED-6548*/} **Product Edition in Version API**
  
  Identify the BloodHound edition programmatically. The [`/api/version`](/reference/api-info/get-api-version) endpoint now includes a `product_edition` field in its response body, allowing you to distinguish between Community and Enterprise editions.

   ```json
   {
      "data": {
        "API": {
          "current_version": "v2",
          "deprecated_version": "v1"
        },
        "server_version": "v8.4.0",
        "product_edition": "enterprise"
      }
    }
   ```
</Update>
