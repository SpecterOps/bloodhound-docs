## Announcements

### State of Attack Path Management
We recently released the inaugural issue of our State of Attack Path Management report, which draws from our unique blend of offensive security assessments and insights from both BloodHound Community Edition and Enterprise. The report introduces Attack Path Management as a fundamental practice requiring a paradigm shift from reactive defense to proactive adversarial thinking.

On August 28, 2025 at 11AM PT, join Jared Atkinson, Elad Shamir, and Andrew Chiles as they break down some of the big points you can take away to better understand and address the attack paths that exist in your environment before they are exploited.

### So long APIv1, and thanks for all the fish
Back in [April of this year](/resources/release-notes/v7-3-0), we announced our intention to deprecate our legacy API around BlackHat 2025. The time has finally arrived to say goodbye to APIv1 of BloodHound Enterprise. Our Technical Acount Managers have been reaching out to any customers who had still been utilizing these endpoints to make certain everyone had migrated successfully to APIv2.

Thank you so much to our customers and Technical Account Managers for helping us sunset the use of this legacy code!

## BloodHound (v8.1.0)

### New and Improved Features

- **Cypher quantifiers on PostgreSQL** - Support for Cypher on PostgreSQL graph databases continue! In this release, we're adding support for quantifiers (ANY, SINGLE, NONE, ALL) within Cypher queries. For more information, check out our [Cypher documentation](/analyze-data/cypher-supported#pattern-predicates)!
- **"Analyze Now"** - BloodHound does a great job of only running analysis when necessary. Even still, there are occasions when kicking off a manual analysis can be quite helpful for certain troubleshooting scenarios. We've introduce a button under Administration -> BloodHound Configuration to kick off a fresh analysis.
