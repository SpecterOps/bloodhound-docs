  ## Keyboard Shortcuts

  Navigate and interact with BloodHound using keyboard shortcuts.

  BloodHound now includes a variety of [keyboard shortcuts](/manage-bloodhound/bh-shortcuts) to enhance navigation and streamline interactions across the platform. 
  
  These shortcuts allow you to quickly access features, execute commands, and navigate between pages without relying solely on mouse input, improving accessibility and efficiency for power users.

  ## Cypher

  See the progress of Cypher queries with enhanced visual feedback.

  The **Run** button in the [Cypher](/analyze-data/cypher-search) search tab now provides a _Running..._ status that indicates when a query is in progress, improving the overall query execution experience.

  ## Custom Date Range Time Input

  Customize time values in posture date range filters.

  The custom date range filter on the [Posture](/analyze-data/posture-page) page now includes a time picker that allows you to specify the exact time when filtering attack paths by date range.
  
  This resolves an issue where the preset date range options (e.g. Last 7 days) used different times of day than the custom date range, which caused inconsistencies in attack path visibility between preset and custom date ranges.

  ## Privilege Zone Management (Renamed)

  The **Privilege Zone Management** page has been renamed **Zone Builder** to better reflect its purpose as a tool for [building and managing zones](/analyze-data/privilege-zones/overview) that represent different levels of privilege within your environment.

    </Frame>

  This enhancement includes several layout and navigation improvements, as well as updates to terminology. Keep reading for details!

  ### Zone and Label Dropdown Menus

  The zone and label **Details View** now includes dropdown menus for navigating between different zones and labels, providing a more intuitive and efficient way to explore zone and label details.
  
  #### Zones

  <Badge shape="rounded" size="sm" color="purple">Enterprise Edition</Badge>

  The zone dropdown menu in the [Details View](/analyze-data/privilege-zones/zones#detail-view) now uses consistent iconography to improve visual recognition and navigation.
  
  The <Icon icon="gem"/> (gem) icon represents the default Tier Zero zone. A new zone icon represents all other zones (unless you've applied a custom glyph to the zone configuration).
  
     <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/release_notes/8_5_0/zone-icon.png"
        alt="A view of the BloodHound main navigation menu showing the new shield icon used for the Zones page, which is now consistent with the iconography used on the Zone Builder page and other zone-related features across the platform."
      />
    </Frame>

  #### Labels

  The label [Details View](/analyze-data/privilege-zones/labels#detail-view) also includes a similar dropdown menu, but does not include icons.

        src="/images/release_notes/8_5_0/label-dropdown.png"
        alt="A view of the BloodHound main navigation menu showing the new tag icon used for the Labels page, which is now consistent with the iconography used on other label-related features across the platform."
      />
    </Frame>
  
  ### Rules

  Navigating the zone and label **Details View** is now more intuitive with categories that group rules based on function:

  - **All Rules**: View all rules that apply to the zone or label
  - **Custom Rules**: View rules that you have created
  - **Default Rules** (zones only): View [default rules](/analyze-data/privilege-zones/default-rules) that come pre-configured with BloodHound
  - **Disabled Rules**: View rules that are currently disabled, regardless of whether they are default or custom
  
      <Note>To see objects for disabled rules, you must re-enable the rule.</Note>

      <img
        src="/images/release_notes/8_5_0/rule-categories.png"
        alt="A view of the Zone Details View showing the new rule categories that group rules based on function: All Rules, Custom Rules, Default Rules, and Disabled Rules."
      />
    </Frame>

  ### Members (Renamed)

  The **Zone Builder** (formerly _Privilege Zone Management_) page and tabs now use the term "objects" instead of "members" to refer to the objects that rules pull into zones and labels.
  
  This change provides more accurate terminology because "members" can be misleading. Rules can tag both objects that directly match object IDs or Cypher queries _and_ objects that BloodHound tags through [expansion](/analyze-data/privilege-zones/rules#rule-expansion).
  
  The new term "objects" encompasses both directly matched and expanded objects, providing clearer communication about how rules function and the resulting tagged objects in zones and labels.

  ### Zone and Label Details

  The zone and label **Details View** now displays details in the following tabs:

  - **Zone**: Displayed by default when opening the zone [Details View](/analyze-data/privilege-zones/zones#detail-view). This tab includes name, description, update history, and status.
  - **Label**: Displayed by default when opening the label [Details View](/analyze-data/privilege-zones/labels#detail-view). This tab includes name, description, and update history.
  - **Rule**: Displayed after selecting a rule. This tab includes name, description, update history, certification state (for zones), type, status, and Cypher query (if applicable).
  - **Object**: Displayed after selecting an object. This tab shows the **Entity** panel containing object properties and relationships.

  {/*BED-6921, BED-6918, BED-6856*/}
  
  ## Rules Form

  The form for creating and editing rules in the Zone Builder now includes several enhancements to improve usability and provide clearer insights into rule configuration and results.
  
  ### Rule Status

  This is a minor enhancement, but one that provides a concise call-to-action for users [managing rules](/analyze-data/privilege-zones/rules#edit-or-delete-a-rule).
  
  When enabling or disabling rules, you'll now see **Enable Rule** instead of **Rule Status** with the status on the same line as the toggle.

        src="/images/release_notes/8_5_0/enable-rule.png"
        alt="A view of the Edit Rule page in Zone Builder showing the updated Enable Rule toggle."
      />
    </Frame>

  ### Direct and Expanded Objects in Sample Results

  BloodHound now separates direct matches (objects that directly match the rule criteria) from expanded matches (objects that are connected to direct matches based on [expansion](/analyze-data/privilege-zones/rules#rule-expansion)) in the **Sample Results** panel when defining rules.
  
  This enhancement provides clearer insights into how rules are applied and which objects are being tagged as a result.

        alt="A view of the Sample Results panel in the Zone Builder page showing the separation between direct matches and expanded matches when defining a rule"
      />
    </Frame>
  
  ### Improved In-Product Guidance for Creating Rules

  BloodHound now provides improved messaging when you [define Cypher-based rules](/analyze-data/privilege-zones/rules#cypher) for zones and labels. If you try to save a Cypher-based rule without first clicking **Update Sample Results**, you'll see a prompt to do so before allowing you to save the rule.

  ## Zone and Label Forms

  BloodHound now provides improved layout and messaging for managing zones and labels, including the following updates:
  
  - The <Icon icon="trash-can" iconType="solid"/> **Delete Zone** button has been moved to the top of the form.
  - A new message at the top of the form specifies the remaining number of zones or labels that you can create and a link to contact sales to increase the limit.
  - A <Icon icon="lock" iconType="solid"/> (lock) icon now appears next to the Tier Zero zone in the **Zone Order** panel to indicate its protected status.

  For zones specifically, the form now also includes the following updates:
  
  - The **Enable Analysis** option has been moved to the top of the form for better visibility.
  - The **Require Certification** option has been renamed to **Enable Certification** for consistency across other forms.

  ## Count by Kind for Selectors

  A new API endpoint is now available that allows you to `GET` member counts by primary kind for asset group tag selectors, with optional environment filtering.

  [/api/v2/asset-group-tags/{asset_group_tag_id}/selectors/{asset_group_tag_selector_id}/members/counts](/reference/asset-isolation/list-asset-group-tag-selector-member-count-by-kind)

</Update>

<Update label="BloodHound" description="Fixed Issues">
## Attack Path Analysis

<Badge shape="rounded" size="sm" color="purple">Enterprise Edition</Badge>

- {/*BED-5719*/} Resolved an issue causing inconsistent attack path visibility. Previously, the preset _date_ range options on the **Posture** page used different _times of day_ than the **Custom Range** option. A new [time picker](#bloodhound-4) is now available for custom date ranges to resolve this inconsistency.

## Explore

- {/*BED-6940*/} Resolved an issue where the search option at the bottom of the **Explore** page on the **Pathfinding** or **Cypher** tabs displayed "unknown" edges in suggested results. Suggested results now return nodes only.

## OpenGraph

- {/*BED-6589*/} Resolved an issue where OpenGraph file ingestion reported "All files failed to ingest as JSON Content" when files contained unresolved relationships. The [file upload API](http://localhost:3000/reference/collection-uploads/upload-file-to-job) now properly handles partial failures.

## Zone Builder

- {/*BED-7084*/} Resolved an issue where creating a large number of rules could exceed database connection limits, fail silently, and prevent tagging objects as expected.

- {/*BED-7083*/} Resolved an issue where object [expansion](/analyze-data/privilege-zones/rules#rule-expansion) in rules fails silently and prevents tagging members as expected.

- {/*BED-6874*/} Resolved an issue where the **Total Count** (renamed to **Total Objects** this release) on the zone and label **Details View** displayed inaccurate object totals when filtering between domains.

- {/*BED-6458*/} <Badge shape="rounded" size="sm" color="purple">Enterprise Edition</Badge> Resolved an issue where the **Tier Zero Exposure** value in the domain filter on the **Attack Paths** and **Posture** pages displayed the same percentage across all zones, preventing an accurate assessment of exposure metrics for individual zones.

- {/*BED-6931*/} <Badge shape="rounded" size="sm" color="purple">Enterprise Edition</Badge> Resolved an issue on the **Certifications** page where clicking **Certify** or **Revoke** without first selecting an object displayed the **Add Note** modal. The buttons are now deactivated until you select an object.

- {/*BED-7150*/}<Badge shape="rounded" size="sm" color="purple">Enterprise Edition</Badge> Resolved an issue where analysis failed on Cypher-based rules. Rules now properly ignore edges and select nodes only.
