- **Update to the Saved Queries UI, plus sharing support!** - The Saved Queries UI just got a massive upgrade and now supports sharing queries within your BloodHound environment! Additionally, this new UI supports searching and filtering, lets you enable auto-run support on click, and will let you import and export your saved queries for re-use!
- **Privilege Zones Functional and Workflow Improvements** - Work on the Privilege Zones early access continues as we near general availability of the functionality. We've added searching and filtering support to the detail view to more rapidly find specific objects, selectors, or to see only things relating to a specific environment. Several areas of the UI got an uplift to make disabled elements more clear, made previews more accurate, added some default sorting, and clarified some workflows.
- **Updates to traversable edges** - `ManageCA` and `ManageCertificates` edges are now marked traversable. With this change, these edges will appear in pathfinding filters, and will effect risk measurement in the Attack Paths page in BloodHound Enterprise, including the addition of several new Attack Path finding types.
- **More context on ADCS Entity Panels** - ADCS and the Attack Paths which result from the improper configuration of the service are incredibly complex. Within BloodHound, our goal is to demystify this complexity and to help users better understand the risks created by these configurations. To that end, we've introduced several new Entity Panel accordions to help provide additional clarity.
  - PKI hierarchy relationships on AIACA, RootCA, and EnterpriseCA objects.
  - Template tracking for EnterpriseCA and CertTemplate objects.
  - Trusted CA relationships for NTAuthStore objects.
  - ADCS escalation paths for Domain objects.
- Improved several pre-saved queries around ADCS, adding searches for ADCSESC5 and ADCSESC8, and clarifying the searches which return data for ADCSESC6, and ADCSESC7.
- Clarified that the "Search" button on the Explore view searches only currently displayed results.
- Updated layouts in Table view to make it more compact, showing more results in the same screen space.
- _[BHE Only]_ Large numbers in the Posture view will now have appropriate comma-separation for improved readability.
- Updated formatting for links in Entity Panels to make them more distinct.
