The BloodHound Enterprise Splunk app provides several dashboards that allow you to gain insights into your environments. These dashboards visualize data ingested from various BloodHound Enterprise data inputs, including posture statistics, attack paths, audit logs, and tier zero assets.

<Tip>You [configure the data inputs](/integrations/splunk/install#configure-the-splunk-app-required) for these dashboards during the installation and configuration of the BloodHound Enterprise Splunk app.</Tip>

Each dashboard offers filtering options to help you analyze the data based on different parameters such as BloodHound Enterprise tenant, domain, and time range.
