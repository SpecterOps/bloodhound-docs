Use the BHE Health Check dashboard to identify issues quickly. Start by filtering to the relevant time window, then use the panels to locate errors and affected functions.

## List index out of range

- Causes:
  - API response does not contain the expected structure
  - Code accesses an empty list without validation

- Steps:
  - Identify the function in the error log table
  - Review recent API changes that could affect response shape
  - Add safe checks before indexing lists (e.g., verify length > 0)

## API authentication (401 Unauthorized)

- Causes:
  - Expired or invalid API token
  - Incorrect credentials in the BHE App configuration

- Steps:
  - Verify the API token value and expiry
  - Confirm correct credentials in the BHE App settings
  - If using OAuth, refresh the access token and restart the app

## Connectivity issues (Timeout/500)

- Causes:
  - Network problems between Splunk and the BHE API
  - API service downtime or high latency

- Steps:
  - Test connectivity with `ping` or `curl` from the Splunk host
  - Verify the BHE API endpoint is reachable from Splunk
  - Check provider status or maintenance notices

## Proxy errors

Example error:

```
HTTPSConnectionPool(host='demo.bloodhoundenterprise.io', port=443):
Max retries exceeded with url: /api/v2/posture-stats
(Caused by ProxyError('Cannot connect to proxy.',
NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x7f7c8b2b4a60>:
Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 113] No route to host')))
```

- Causes:
  - Incorrect proxy settings in Splunk
  - Proxy server unreachable or misconfigured

- Steps:
  - Verify Splunk proxy settings match your network configuration
  - Check the proxy server status and reachability from Splunk
  - Test connectivity with `curl -x <proxy> https://demo.bloodhoundenterprise.io`

## Using the Health Check for troubleshooting

- Identify the function causing the error in the Detailed Error Logs table
- Look for recurring errors in Error Summary and Top Error Functions
- Apply the relevant steps above based on the error type
- If issues persist, inspect Splunk internal logs
