You can configure multiple SSO providers within your tenant if you need to.

This page provides the overall steps to configure an OIDC provider within BloodHound.

## Order of Operations

Currently, BloodHound requires the configuration of OIDC system in the following order:

1.  Determine the Provider Name you will utilize for the SAML configuration.
    * The exact value must be configured in both the Identity Provider and BloodHound.
2.  Configure Identity Provider for BloodHound.
    * You will need the Client ID and Issuer provided by your IDP to move foward.
3.  Create the OIDC Configuration in BloodHound.
    #### You must ensure OIDC users do not share email with built-in or SAML users. Email requires a unique value so account creation will fail.

## BloodHound Icons

If your IDP supports custom icons for configured applications, please feel free to utilize the logos below:

### Automatically create new users on login
Enabling this option will have Bloodhound create a new user on thie first login with SSO (Just In Time). The user will be granted the role slug passed in the role claim if included, else the default role will be assigned.

### Allow SSO Provider to modify roles
Enabling this option allows the SSO provider to modify user roles. This is accomplished by updating the role claim associated with the user account. The role will be updated on the next login. 
To have this take effect immediately, disable then re-enable the user to invalidate current sessions and force a fresh login.

5. BloodHound will provide the URLs related to this new OIDC provider integration.

## Configure Users for OIDC Authentication

By default, all users will use a username and password via the built-in authentication service. SSO may be set during user creation or edited for an existing user. 

Ensure any built-in users will not have the same email address as potential SSO users as email must be unique and account creation will fail.

1.  While logged in as an Administrator, open the slider on the left, then click "Administration."

  * When provisioning is enabled without the modify role option, a user's role may be updated manually after creation.
  * If both provisioning and modify role are enabled, role updates must come from the SSO.
