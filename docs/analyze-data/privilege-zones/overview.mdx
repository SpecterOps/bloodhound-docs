Privilege Zones has two tabs: Tiers (Zones) and Labels. Zones allow the logical separation of objects into three unique hierarchical groups according to the structure of your environment. Labels are a flexible tool to categorically bucket different objects. Together, these tools enable further risk mitigation in your environments by highlighting the violations and misconfigurations to your customized network model.

Zones and Labels each offer two views: **Summary** and **Detail**. Use the view selector (drop-down) in the UI to toggle between them.
- **Summary** shows the zone/label name, selector count, object count, and, for Zones, their hierarchy (the top zone is most critical).
- **Detail** lists every selector and the objects that each selector pulls into the chosen zone or label.
