Privilege Zones help you organize objects in your environment into logical groups based on their privilege and risk levels. Using Privilege Zones, you can monitor and maintain the security posture of tiered isolation models.

## Key concepts

Before diving into Privilege Zones, let's define some key concepts:

| Concept   | Description                                                                                                                                      | Used in Risk Analysis |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Zone**  | A group of objects that represent the hierarchy of control across all domains in an environment based on access level                            | Yes                  |
| **Label** | A flexible way to categorize a group of objects in a single zone (or across multiple zones) for easier searching and filtering                   | No                   |
| **Selector** | A rule that associates objects with zones and labels based on object types, object relationships (expansion), or Cypher queries               | Yes                  |

Zones organize objects into a strict hierarchy. BloodHound analyzes how object privileges are assigned and where they can be escalated across your environment.

By default, BloodHound includes a Tier Zero zone that represents a set of objects with full control over an environment _and_ any objects with control over those objects. See [Tier Zero: Members and Modification](/get-started/security-boundaries/tier-zero-members) to learn more.

<Note>You can [create up to two additional zones](/analyze-data/privilege-zones/zones-and-labels) to match your organization's security model.</Note>

If BloodHound detects an object in a lower-privileged zone controlling an object in a higher-privileged zone, it identifies it as a finding in the **Attack Paths** and **[Posture](/analyze-data/posture-page)** pages. For example, if a Tier One user can control a Tier Zero server, BloodHound flags it as a violation of the privilege model.

This analysis helps you identify and remediate privilege escalation paths and misconfigurations that violate your security model.
