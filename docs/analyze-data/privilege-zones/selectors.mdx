Zone Selectors provide a logical method of ensuring objects appear in the appropriate zone using either a Cypher query or by searching for an object ID. **If an object has been added to multiple Zones, the most critical zone in your defined hierarchy will take precedence.**

Label Selectors are a flexible method of tagging objects in the environments. Objects can have multiple labels, and those labels are searchable and filterable using Cypher in the Explore page. The process and screens for creating and editing label selectors is the same as creating or editing zone selectors.

Any changes made to a selector will take effect on the next analysis.

<Note>See [Default Selectors](/analyze-data/privilege-zones/default-selectors) for a list of predefined selectors included with BloodHound.</Note>

## Defining a Selector

If you start defining a selector via the zone creation process, skip to step 2.

1. From the Zone or Labels tab, select "Create Selector"
2. Provide a name
3. Optionally add a description to explain to others on your team, including yourself, the purpose of the Selector
4. Choose a selector type: Cypher or object ID
5. If using Cypher:
   1. Enter the Cypher query into the "Cypher Search" box
   2. To see the sample results, click "Update Sample Results" above the Cypher query box. The first 200 sample results will populate the list to the right
   3. Optionally, click "View in Explore" to pivot to the explore page and view the full Cypher query results
6. If using object ID
   1. Type in the blank to search for an object
   2. Select that object to add to the list
7. Adding the following object types will automatically include (→) more objects according to the definition below
   1. OU/Container → All objects contained in the OU/container
   2. Group → All objects with membership in the Group
   3. AZResourceGroup/AZSubscription → All objects contained in the RG/Sub
   4. AZGroup → All objects with membership in the group
   5. AZRole → All objects with role assignments (or eligibility)
8. Click "Save" to finalize the creation of the selector

Selectors can be enabled or disabled by editing the selector.
