## Zones define hierarchical privilege levels in your environment. The most common tiering model is [Microsoft's Enterprise Access Model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/privileged-access-workstations/privileged-access-access-model). 

- BloodHound uses zones to measure risk and detect violations
- Each zone has a specific tier level (Tier Zero is the highest)
- You can create multiple tiers (Tier One, Tier Two, etc.) to match your security model

## Labels

Labels let you tag groups of objects for easier searching and filtering. Unlike zones, labels don't affect risk analysisâ€”they simply help you organize and query your data.

- Use labels to mark objects with common characteristics (e.g., "PCI", "Owned", "Production")
- You can filter views and queries based on labels
- Example: Tag PCI-scoped systems to quickly identify attack paths from non-PCI to PCI environments
