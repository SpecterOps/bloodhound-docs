The _Privilege Zones_ page has two tabs:

- **Zones**—Zones allow the logical separation of objects into three unique hierarchical groups according to the structure of your environment.
- **Labels**—Labels are a flexible tool to categorically bucket different objects.

Together, these tools enable further risk mitigation in your environments by highlighting the violations and misconfigurations to your customized network model.

The _Zones_ and _Labels_ pages each offer two views:

- **Summary**—Shows the zone/label name, selector count, object count, and, for Zones, their hierarchy (the top zone is most critical).
- **Detail**—Lists every selector and the objects that each selector pulls into the chosen zone or label.

Use the view selector (drop-down) in the UI to toggle between them.

## Zones define hierarchical privilege levels in your environment. The most common tiering model is [Microsoft's Enterprise Access Model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/privileged-access-workstations/privileged-access-access-model). 

- BloodHound uses zones to measure risk and detect violations
- Each zone has a specific tier level (Tier Zero is the highest)
- You can create multiple tiers (Tier One, Tier Two, etc.) to match your security model

## Labels

Labels let you tag groups of objects for easier searching and filtering. Unlike zones, labels don't affect risk analysis—they simply help you organize and query your data.

- Use labels to mark objects with common characteristics (e.g., "PCI", "Owned", "Production")
- You can filter views and queries based on labels
- Example: Tag PCI-scoped systems to quickly identify attack paths from non-PCI to PCI environments

## Creating a Privilege Zone

1. Navigate to "Privilege Zones" in the left menu

2. Click "Create Tier"

  alt="Create a tier"
  title="Create a tier"
  style={{ width:"53%" }}
/>

3. Enter all relevant information about the zone

  title="Configure new zone"
  style={{ width:"53%" }}
/>

4. Click "Define Selector" to save your new Privilege Zone and continue on to define the objects to include in the zone

## Creating a Label

1. Select "Create Label"
2. Add a name and an optional description
3. Click "Define Selector" to save the label
