The **Privilege Zones** page provides the following tabs:

- **Zones**: A group of objects that represent the hierarchy of control across all domains in an environment based on access level
- **Labels**: A flexible way to categorize a group of objects in a single zone (or across multiple zones) for easier searching and filtering
- **Certification**: An optional process to interrupt automatic inclusion of additional objects in a zone by requiring manual certification of the additional objects
- **History**: An audit log of changes made to your zones and labels over time

These tools enable further risk mitigation in your environments by highlighting the violations and misconfigurations to your tiered network model.

The **Zones** and **Labels** tabs offer two views:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Summary View">
  The **Summary View** shows zone/label names, selector counts, member count, and (for zones) their hierarchy relative to other zones (the top zone is most critical).

    />
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Detail View">
  The **Detail View** lists every selector and member that each selector pulls into the associated zone or label.

## Zones

Zones define hierarchical privilege levels in your environment based on a tiered administration model. The most common tiering model is [Microsoft's Enterprise Access Model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/privileged-access-workstations/privileged-access-access-model). 

BloodHound uses zones to measure risk and detect violations. Each zone has a specific tier level (**Tier Zero** is the default and highest). You can create multiple zones (e.g., Tier One, Tier Two) to match your security model.

### Create a zone

Creating a zone involves configuring the zone details and defining a selector.

<SelectorWarning/>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Privilege Zones page">
  In the left menu, click **Privilege Zones** > **Zones** > **Create Zone**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure initial zone details">

      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Labels

Labels let you tag groups of objects for easier searching and filtering. Use labels to mark objects with common characteristics (e.g., "PCI", "Owned", "Production").

You can filter views and queries based on labels. For example, label PCI-scoped systems to quickly identify attack paths from non-PCI to PCI environments.

<Note>Unlike zones, BloodHound does not use labels in risk analysisâ€”they're designed to help you organize and query your data.</Note>

### Create a label

Creating a label involves configuring the label details and defining a selector.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Privilege Zones page">
  In the left menu, click **Privilege Zones** > **Labels** > **Create Label**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure initial label details">
  Enter all relevant information about the label:

  | Field                | Required?    | Description                                                                                   |
  |----------------------|:------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Name                 | Yes          | A unique name for the label (e.g., PCI)                                                       |
  | Description          | No           | A brief description of the label's purpose and scope (e.g., PCI assets)                       |

## Certification

Certification is an optional process to interrupt automatic inclusion of additional objects in a zone based on [selector](/analyze-data/privilege-zones/selectors) expansion behavior by requiring manual certification of the additional objects. It allows administrators or power users to manually review and approve objects before they appear in privilege zones.

This process gives you control over zone membership and helps prevent unexpected additions from triggering false findings.

<img
  src="/images/privzones/certification.png"
  alt="Privilege Zones certification tab"
  title="Privilege Zones certification tab"
  style={{ width:"100%" }}
/>

### Why use certification?

Without certification, BloodHound automatically includes objects in zones as soon as they match a selector's expansion criteria. This can create unexpected findings when objects are inadvertently added to privileged groups.

For example, if a new user is added to the Domain Admins group, BloodHound immediately tags them to the **Tier Zero** zone and generates attack path findings for that user. 

In the precediing example, certification solves this problem by requiring manual approval before objects are fully recognized within a zone. During the certification process, BloodHound still identifies the object's relationship to the zone but generates a "Non-Certified Principal with Tier Zero Privileges" finding instead of standard attack path findings. 

This gives you time to review whether the object should remain in the zone or if its group membership was a mistake.

<Note>BloodHound supports certification for zones only.</Note>

### How certification works

When you enable certification for a zone:

1. Objects that match the zone's selectors enter a pending state
2. BloodHound generates findings indicating the objects require certification
3. Administrators or power users review pending objects in the **Certification** tab
4. Once certified, objects are fully recognized in the zone and BloodHound generates standard findings
5. Alternatively, you can remove objects from privileged groups to prevent zone membership

You can configure certification requirements at the zone level (to affect all selectors) or at the individual [selector](/analyze-data/privilege-zones/selectors) level, giving you flexibility in managing object approvals.

### Manage certifications

The **Certification** tab in the **Privilege Zones** page allows administrators and power users to review, approve, or revoke certifications for objects in zones where manual certification has been configured.

<Note>
- You can certify or revoke certification only for objects in zones where certification is enabled.
- Objects appear in the certification queue only when their [selectors](/analyze-data/privilege-zones/selectors) have **Automatic Certification** turned off.
</Note>

To manage certifications:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Certification tab">
    Navigate to the **Privilege Zones** > **Certification** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter certifications">
    Click the status drop-down menu and choose **Pending**, **User Certified**, or **Rejected** to view relevant certifications.

    <Note>Actions are only available for certifications that require manual approval. You cannot approve or revoke **Automatic Certifications**.</Note>

       alt="Privilege Zones certification status drop-down menu"
       style={{ width:"100%" }}
     />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete the certification action">
    1. Use the checkboxes to select one or more objects.

    1. Click **Approve Certification** or **Revoke Certification** as needed.

    1. _(Optional)_ Add a note to document the reason for your action.

       - Click **Skip Note** to complete the certification action without a note
       - Click **Cancel** to exit without completing the certification action
