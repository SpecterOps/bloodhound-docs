Zones define hierarchical privilege levels in your environment based on a tiered administration model. The most common tiering model is [Microsoft's Enterprise Access Model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/privileged-access-workstations/privileged-access-access-model). 

BloodHound uses zones to measure risk and detect violations. Each zone has a specific tier level (**Tier Zero** is the default and highest). You can create multiple zones (e.g., Tier One, Tier Two) to match your security model.

The **Zones** tab offers two views:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Summary View">
  The **Summary View** shows zone names and their hierarchy relative to other zones (the top zone is most critical), rule counts, and object counts.

      alt="A view of the Zone Builder summary view"
    />
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Detail View">
  The **Detail View** displays all rules configured for the selected zone and the objects that they pull into the zone (organized by node type). Use the drop-down menus to filter the view by specific zones and domains in your environment.

  Select a rule or object to display more details in the right panel, including:
  
  - Rule definition and Cypher query
  - Object properties and relationships

  <Note>BloodHound displays objects for enabled rules only. To view objects related to a disabled rule, you must re-enable it.</Note>

### Edit or delete a zone

To edit or delete an existing zone, follow these steps:

<Note>You cannot delete the default **Tier Zero** zone, but you can modify its properties. See [Modify Tier Zero](/get-started/security-boundaries/modifying-tier-zero) for more information.</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a zone">
   Navigate to the **Zones** tab, select the zone you want to edit or delete, and click **Edit Zone**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit or delete a zone">
    Choose one of the following actions:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Edit a zone" icon="edit">
      To edit the zone:

      1. Modify one of the available fields.

         For example, you can modify the zone's name, description, [certification](#certification) and analysis settings, and custom glyph.

       1. With the exception of the default **Tier Zero** zone, you can also change the zone's hierarchical position by using the vertical grip control (<Icon icon="grip-vertical" iconType="solid" />) in the **Zone Order** panel to reorder it.

          Zone order is defined by privilege level, with the highest-privileged zone at the top.
