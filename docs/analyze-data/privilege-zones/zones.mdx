Zones define hierarchical privilege levels in your environment based on a tiered administration model. The most common tiering model is [Microsoft's Enterprise Access Model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/privileged-access-workstations/privileged-access-access-model). 

BloodHound uses zones to measure risk and detect violations. Each zone has a specific tier level (**Tier Zero** is the default and highest). You can create multiple zones (e.g., Tier One, Tier Two) to match your security model.

The **Zones** tab offers two views:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Summary View">
  The **Summary View** shows zone names, rule counts, object counts, and their hierarchy relative to other zones (the top zone is most critical).

    />
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Detail View">
  The **Detail View** lists every rule and object that each rule pulls into the associated zone.

  Use the **Domain Selector** to filter the view by specific domains in your environment.

### Edit or delete a zone

To edit or delete an existing zone, follow these steps:

<Note>You cannot delete the default **Tier Zero** zone, but you can modify its properties. See [Modify Tier Zero](/get-started/security-boundaries/modifying-tier-zero) for more information.</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a zone">
   Navigate to the **Zones** tab, select the zone you want to edit or delete, and click **Edit Zone**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit or delete a zone">
    Choose one of the following actions:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Edit a zone" icon="edit">
      To edit the zone:

      1. Modify one of the available fields.

         For example, you can modify the zone's name, description, [certification](#certification) and analysis settings, and custom glyph.

       1. With the exception of the default **Tier Zero** zone, you can also change the zone's hierarchical position by using the vertical grip control (<Icon icon="grip-vertical" iconType="solid" />) in the **Zone Order** panel to reorder it.

          Zone order is defined by privilege level, with the highest-privileged zone at the top.
