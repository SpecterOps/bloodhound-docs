This page details the various ways you can install BloodHound Community Edition depending on your use case and needs.

## TOC

TODO: Add TOC

## Prerequisites

TODO: Convert Prereq in Quick Start to Snippet and add here

## Install via BloodHound-CLI

This is the prefered way and simplest, most straigth forward way to install BHCE. It should be favored by most users. 

TODO: Convert Quick Start instruction to Snippet and add here

## Install via Docker Compose

This installation method gives you more control on each file and is also better suited to run multiple BHCE instances on a single machine. You can get more information on how to do that in the [Customizations](#customizations) section below.

1. Recommended: Create a folder to store the config files for your BHCE instance

1. Download a sample [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpecterOps/BloodHound/refs/heads/main/examples/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml) file.

1. Download a sample [bloodhound.config.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpecterOps/BloodHound/refs/heads/main/examples/docker-compose/bloodhound.config.json) file.


## Build from source

### Prerequisite

Details can be found here : https://github.com/SpecterOps/BloodHound/wiki/Development#prerequisites  
We should probably make sure we update the version. 

### Setting up your environment

### Compiling BHCE

**NOTE**: We should probably include more information from that page or at least provide a link to it


## Customizations 

### Swithching Backend

Postgresql offers great advantages over Neo4j as a backend most noticeable is the speed, but it also have a few drawbacks most notable one being the support for some `Cypher` verbs and syntax. Please see [Supported Cypher Syntax](/analyze-data/cypher-supported) for up to date Cypher support in Postgres

#### Using PG as the Graph Database

1. First, we need to edit `bloodhound.config.json` and add a line in the main section to use PG as the Graph Database

`"graph_driver": "pg",`

This is an example of adding the line between `default_password` and `log_level`, but it can be anywhere at that "level".

``` json
{
  "bind_addr": "0.0.0.0:8080",
  "collectors_base_path": "/etc/bloodhound/collectors",
  "default_admin": {
    "password": "<SOMETHING>",
    "principal_name": "admin"
  },
  "default_password": "<SOMETHING>",
  "graph_driver": "pg",
  "log_level": "INFO",
  "log_path": "bloodhound.log",
  "metrics_port": ":2112",
  "recreatedefaultadmin": "false",
  "root_url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
  "tls": {
    "cert_file": "",
    "key_file": ""
  },
  "version": 1,
  "work_dir": "/opt/bloodhound/work"
}%                               
```

2. Clean up the `docker-compose.yml` file

- Delete the whole section about `graph_db`

``` yaml
  graph-db:
    labels:
      name: "bhce_neo4j"
    image: docker.io/library/neo4j:4.4
    environment:
      - NEO4J_AUTH=${NEO4J_USER:-neo4j}/${NEO4J_SECRET:-bloodhoundcommunityedition}
      - NEO4J_dbms_allow__upgrade=${NEO4J_ALLOW_UPGRADE:-true}
    # Database ports are disabled by default. Please change your database password to something secure before uncommenting
    ports:
      - 127.0.0.1:${NEO4J_DB_PORT:-7687}:7687
      - 0.0.0.0:${NEO4J_WEB_PORT:-7474}:7474
    volumes:
      - ${NEO4J_DATA_MOUNT:-neo4j-data}:/data
    healthcheck:
      test:
        [
          "CMD-SHELL",
          "wget -O /dev/null -q http://localhost:7474 || exit 1"
        ]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 30s

```

- Delete those 2 lines at the end of the `bloodhound:` section

``` yaml
      graph-db:
        condition: service_healthy
```

- Delete this line from the `volumes:` section

``` yaml
  neo4j-data:
```

#### Using Neo4j as the Graph Database

If you are currently using a Postgres backend database and want to switch to Neo4j follow these steps.

1. Replace your `docker-compose.yml` file with this one

      ### The left side is the environment variable you're setting for bloodhound, the variable on the right in `${}`
      ### is the variable available outside of Docker
    ports:
      ### Default to localhost to prevent accidental publishing of the service to your outer networks
      ### These can be modified by your .env file or by setting the environment variables in your Docker host OS
      - ${BLOODHOUND_HOST:-127.0.0.1}:${BLOODHOUND_PORT:-8080}:8080
    ### Uncomment to use your own bloodhound.config.json to configure the application
    volumes:
      - ./bloodhound.config.json:/bloodhound.config.json:ro
    depends_on:
      app-db:
        condition: service_healthy
      graph-db:
        condition: service_healthy

volumes:
  neo4j-data:
  postgres-data:
```

2. Delete the following line from `bloodhound.config.json`

`"graph_driver": "pg",`

**Note**: This line might need to be change for `"graph_driver": "Neo4j" when PG is the default database

### Running multiple BHCE instances simultaneously

Typical use cases: 
- Want to run a version with a Neo4j backend and a version with a PG backend
- Want to test the newest version without loosing/breaking your current installation
- Running multiple engagements and keeping the data separated

<Note>Each instance will need to bind to a different port on the machine it is run on. The step below will show you which settings needs to be edited.</Note> 

1. Change the web portal port
In `docker-compose.yml` change the following line to your new custom port. In this example, we will run the new instance on port `8585` instead of the defaut `8080`. 

``` yaml
      - ${BLOODHOUND_HOST:-127.0.0.1}:${BLOODHOUND_PORT:-8585}:8080
```

2. If you are running 2 Neo4j databases you will also need to change the Neo4j Web Console port. In `docker-compose.yml` change the following lines to your new custom port. In this example, we will run the new instance on port `7575` instead of the defaut `7474` to match our `8585` port above. 

``` yaml
      - 0.0.0.0:${NEO4J_WEB_PORT:-7575}:7474

      [...]

          "wget -O /dev/null -q http://localhost:7575 || exit 1"
```

<Note>As the Neo4j database port `7687` is not exposed outside of the docker container, it doesn't need to be changed</Note>
